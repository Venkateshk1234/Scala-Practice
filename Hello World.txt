1. A "Hello World" program has been widely adopted as the introductory program for learning how to code. 
So, let's start functional programming by writing the same program.

Sample Input
(Nil)  
Sample Output
Hello World
Method Signature
Number Of Parameters: 0
Parameters: []
Returns: nil
Behavior: Prints "Hello World"
For Hackers Using Clojure
This will be the outline of your function body. Fill in the blank portion marked by the underscores.

For Hackers Using Scala
This will be the outline of your function body. Fill in the blank portion marked by the underscores.
 def f() = ________________

Output:
-------
def f() = println("Hello World")

2. Print "Hello World"  amount of times. The input portion will be handled automatically. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.
